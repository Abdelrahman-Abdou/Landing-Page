# Landing Page Project

 All files of the starter code present and the browser  successfully render a home page with clear design and functionality added when index.html is loaded in the browser. No errors should display in console.

Styling has been added for active states. While scrolling, active style moves to the active section rendering it into blue background


HTML structure contains 5 sections that have been added to the page. 


Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list not through HTML but with Js codes. When you press an menu list-item, it moves you smoothly to the relative section.


Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read format. 


Please, accept my finest regards,
Thank you.
